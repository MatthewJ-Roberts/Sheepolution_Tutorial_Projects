This is a huge monster pack that I have been working on for a few years. As of version 1.0, it contains 56 monsters with both front sprites and back sprites. Everything included is licenced as Creative Commons 0 (CC0). All of the monster designs were made by isaiah658 except for monsters #26 and #47. Those are based on designs from j0j0n4th4n which I modified to fit the style of my other monsters. Both the original and modified versions are licenced as Creative Commons 0 (CC0). Original monster #26 (https://opengameart.org/content/flute-snake-lite) and monster #47 (https://opengameart.org/content/mollufant).

There's only one design rule that all monsters must follow. The monster sprites can only have pure black and 4 other colors. All sprites are 64 x 64 pixels. Each monster also has a special alternative color palette. These alternative colors tend to lean more towards vibrant colors, but you might find some of them to even better than the original colors.

If you find this monster pack useful, I've also made a 3D version of this monster pack (https://opengameart.org/content/50-monsters-pack-3d). It has all the same monsters you see here except 3D. You might also find my Pixel Pack #2 (https://opengameart.org/content/isaiah658s-pixel-pack-2) and Pixel Pack #1 (https://opengameart.org/content/isaiah658s-pixel-pack-1) to be useful as well. Some of the monsters in this pack are even included in my Pixel Pack #2, but I've opted to share them separately due to the amount of new monsters and to make it easier to keep the 2D and 3D versions synced.

Do you like these monsters? Do you wish that you could play a game that uses these monsters? If so, you don't have to wait because it already exists! All of these monsters are used in my Minetest mod called Zoonami (https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=25356). You can collect, train, and battle all of these monsters. You can even battle your friends if you playing on the same server.

Minetest is an open source voxel game engine. Since Zoonami is a "mod" and not a standalone "game", you'll need to download a game first, such as Minetest Game (https://content.minetest.net/packages/Minetest/minetest_game/) or Mineclonia (https://content.minetest.net/packages/ryvnf/mineclonia/). Minetest allows you to browse both games and mods and install them automatically via the in-game content manager, but you can also install them manually. You can also install the Zoonami 3D Mobs mod (https://content.minetest.net/packages/isaiah658/zoonami_3d_mobs/) to change the 2D monsters roaming around into 3D monsters.

Because names fall under trademarks and not copyright, I have exluded names for the monsters. I don't want to mislead anyone into using a name that might be trademarked. I have instead numbered each monster.

I'm thankful for the skill and time God has given me to complete this project. I'm even more thankful that God has given me a path to Heaven through Jesus Christ. For anyone wondering how you can get right with God and have a path to Heaven, GotQuestions.org (https://www.gotquestions.org/) has answers. It introduced me to the Bible and I've continued using the website for over a decade.
